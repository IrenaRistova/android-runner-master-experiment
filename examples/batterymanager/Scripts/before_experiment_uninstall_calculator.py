"""``before_experiment`` hook: chain device-state controls + BATTERY_STATS auto-grant + Calculator uninstall.

Same pattern as the metronome / pdfviewer / horoscapp / crcontainer uninstall hooks.

PACKAGE = ``com.exponential_groth.calculator`` — applicationId is unsuffixed across debug
+ release (no ``applicationIdSuffix`` in ``app/build.gradle``), so the same value works
for every variant including Bangcle.
