"""Default ``before_experiment`` hook (catch-all for non-Metronome configs).

Chained hooks (in order; mirrors ``before_experiment_uninstall_metronome.py``):

  1. **E0.T8 — device-state controls** (``before_experiment_apply_device_state``):
     screen brightness lock, best-effort software charge-disable, discharge-validity
     check, per-device capability cache. May call ``sys.exit(1)`` only when
     ``MASTEREXP_STRICT_DISCHARGE_CHECK=1`` and discharge cannot be verified.

  2. **E0.T10 — BATTERY_STATS auto-grant** (``before_experiment_grant_battery_stats``):
     idempotent ``pm grant`` for the BatteryManager companion.

This file remains the catch-all default for legacy / non-Metronome experiment
configs that don't have a dedicated per-app uninstall hook. Wiring the chain
here means every experiment that goes through AndroidRunner — regardless of which
``before_experiment`` script is wired in its JSON — gets device-state controls +
USB-supply masking mitigation automatically.

Both this and ``before_experiment_uninstall_metronome.py`` call the same helpers.
The helpers are idempotent so chaining both would be safe; on a Metronome run,
the chain fires from the uninstall hook first and this module is never invoked.

Failure handling: any exception is caught and logged to stderr; AndroidRunner
continues. The harness must never crash inside a hook (the only intentional exit
is strict-mode discharge-check abort, which is a documented opt-in).
