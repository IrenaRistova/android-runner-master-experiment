"""``before_experiment`` hook: chain device-state controls + BATTERY_STATS grant + HoroscApp uninstall.

Same pattern as the metronome / pdfviewer / diaguard uninstall hooks. See
``before_experiment_uninstall_metronome.py`` for the canonical docstring.

PACKAGE = ``com.angelsoft.horoscapp`` — applicationId is unsuffixed across debug + release.

Note: CAMERA permission is granted PER RUN (after install) by
``interaction_appium_horoscapp.py`` via ``device.shell("pm grant ... CAMERA")``, NOT here,
because ``pm grant`` requires the app to already be installed and this hook runs BEFORE the
per-run install.
