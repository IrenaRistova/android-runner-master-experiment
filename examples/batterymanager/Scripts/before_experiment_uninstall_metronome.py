"""``before_experiment`` hook: chain device-state controls + BATTERY_STATS auto-grant + Metronome uninstall.

The original responsibility of this hook (uninstall the previous Metronome install
so the next install is a clean one from the experiment's APK path) is preserved
unchanged.

Chained hooks (in order):

  1. **E0.T8 — device-state controls** (``before_experiment_apply_device_state``):
     screen brightness lock, best-effort software charge-disable, discharge-validity
     check, per-device capability cache. May call ``sys.exit(1)`` if
     ``MASTEREXP_STRICT_DISCHARGE_CHECK=1`` and discharge cannot be verified —
     this is intentional and only happens in the strict mode used for the eventual
     thesis batch. Default lenient mode logs a warning and continues; the per-row
     ``notes`` column will carry ``energy_invalid_usb_supplying`` for runs whose
     discharge could not be verified.

  2. **E0.T10 — BATTERY_STATS auto-grant** (``before_experiment_grant_battery_stats``):
     idempotent ``pm grant`` for the BatteryManager companion. Required for the
     unprivileged-API USB-supply masking mitigation (noise sources § 1).

  3. Original Metronome uninstall: removes any prior install so the experiment's
     declared APK path becomes the install of record.

Order rationale: physical-world state first (brightness, charge), then permission
state (BATTERY_STATS), then subject state (uninstall). Each step is wrapped so a
failure in one does NOT skip the others. Every failure path logs to stderr and
continues; the harness must never crash inside a hook (the only intentional exit
is the strict-mode discharge-check abort, which is a documented opt-in).
